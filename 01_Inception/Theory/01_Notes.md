# React.js ‚Äì Introduction, History, and Usage

## üìå What is React?

**React** is an open-source JavaScript library used for building **user interfaces**, especially for **single-page applications (SPAs)**. It allows developers to build web apps that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

React focuses on the **view layer** of the application (in MVC architecture) and encourages the creation of reusable UI components.

## üï∞Ô∏è History of React

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **2011** | React was created by **Jordan Walke**, a software engineer at **Facebook**. |
| **2013** | Facebook **open-sourced** React at JSConf US. |
| **2015** | React Native was released for building mobile apps. |
| **2016+** | Gained popularity and became a key framework in the modern JavaScript ecosystem. |
| **Today** | Maintained by **Meta (Facebook)** and a community of developers. Used by companies like Instagram, Airbnb, Netflix, and more. |

## üß† Core Concepts of React

- **Components**: Independent, reusable pieces of UI.
- **JSX**: JavaScript XML ‚Äì a syntax extension that looks like HTML but works in JavaScript.
- **Props**: Short for "properties"; used to pass data between components.
- **State**: A way to manage local data in a component.
- **Virtual DOM**: A lightweight copy of the real DOM that improves performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use React

### üî∏ 1. Using CDN (for learning/demo)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>React CDN Example</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">
      function App() {
        return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
      }

      const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
      ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(<App />);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
-The crossorigin attribute is used to handle CORS requests for CDN scripts.
-type="text/babel" tells the browser to use Babel to compile JSX.
```


# ‚öõÔ∏è What is CDN in React and Why Do We Use It?

## ‚úÖ What is a CDN?

A **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** is a network of servers distributed across different locations to deliver **static resources** like:
- JavaScript libraries
- CSS files
- Images
- Fonts

The files are loaded from the **nearest server** to the user, improving speed and reducing latency.

---

## üì¶ Why Use CDN in React?

In **React applications**, CDNs are often used for:

### 1. **Loading External Libraries**
You can load popular libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, or FontAwesome via CDN in `public/index.html`:

```html
<!-- Bootstrap CSS via CDN -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css"
/>

<!-- FontAwesome Icons -->
<script
  src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/your-kit-id.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

### 2. Improving Performance
- Instead of bundling everything in your build, CDN resources are:
- Cached in users' browsers
- Delivered faster from nearby servers

### 3. Smaller Bundle Size
Your React bundle will be smaller if you load heavy libraries (like jQuery, Bootstrap) from a CDN.

### üîê What is crossorigin in React?
The crossorigin attribute in React (or HTML) defines how the browser should handle cross-origin requests when loading resources like:
- Scripts
- Fonts
- Stylesheets
- APIs

### üåê Cross-Origin Means:
Loading a resource from a different domain, protocol, or port.

### üî∏ crossorigin Values:

| Value             | Meaning                                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anonymous`       | Sends **no credentials** (no cookies or auth headers). Most common.    |
| `use-credentials` | Sends **cookies/auth headers**, server must allow it via CORS headers. |

### ‚úÖ When Do You Need crossorigin?
- When loading fonts/scripts from a CDN
- When you expect the browser to cache and reuse resources correctly
- When using integrity attribute for security (SRI)

### üìå Summary

| Concept           | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CDN in React**  | Load external libraries quickly and reduce bundle size       |
| **`crossorigin`** | Define whether to send credentials for cross-origin requests |

### üìå New Concepts
# ‚öõÔ∏è React Core Methods Explained

This guide explains how `React.createElement`, `ReactDOM.createRoot`, and `.render()` work together to render UI in React without using JSX.

---

## üß± 1. React.createElement()

### ‚úÖ What it does:
Creates a **virtual DOM element** in memory. This is how JSX is compiled internally by React.

### üß™ Syntax:
```js
React.createElement(type, props, children);
```
### üîπ Parameters:
- type: The HTML tag or React component name (e.g., 'div', 'h1', MyComponent)

- props: An object with HTML attributes or event handlers (e.g., { id: 'title' })

- children: The inner content (text or nested elements)

### üßæ Example:
```
const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "mainTitle", style: { color: "blue" } },
  "Hello from React"
);
```
### üå± 2. ReactDOM.createRoot()
## ‚úÖ What it does:
Creates a React root to manage the rendering of components into the actual DOM.

## üß™ Syntax:
```
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
```
## üìå Purpose:
- Required in React 18+ for concurrent rendering

- Replaces the old ReactDOM.render() method

### üéØ 3. root.render()
## ‚úÖ What it does:
Renders your React element or component into the real DOM.

## üß™ Syntax:
```
root.render(ReactElementOrComponent);
```
## üßæ Example:
```
root.render(heading); // Renders the heading element created earlier
```
### üìåSummary
| Method                  | Purpose                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `React.createElement()` | Creates a virtual DOM element           |
| `ReactDOM.createRoot()` | Prepares React to render in a container |
| `root.render()`         | Renders the virtual DOM into real DOM   |

## Ques): What is `Emmet`?
**Ans:** `Emmet` is a web development toolkit that enables developers to write HTML and CSS code more `quickly and efficiently`. <br/>
It allows you to `type shortcuts` that are then expanded into full pieces of code for writing `HTML and CSS`, based on an abbreviation structure most developers already use that expands into full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules. <br/>
It was originally a `plugin` for various text editors, such as Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Atom, but it has become a widely adopted set of tools integrated into many modern code editors. 
### _Example_
Input:
```sh
  ul>li*3>a
```
Output:
```html
  <ul>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
  </ul>
```
This expands into an `unordered list(ul)` with `three list items(li), each containing an anchor(a)` element.


## Ques): Difference between a `Library and Framework`? (Important)
**Ans:** Both the `framework and library` is `precoded` support programs to `develop` complex software `applications`.

A `framework` is a `set of pre-written code` that provides a structure for developing software applications. A `library`, on the other hand, is a `collection of pre-written code` that can be used to perform specific tasks.

A `library` is a `collection of packages` that perform specific operations whereas a `framework` contains the basic flow and architecture of an application. The major difference between them is the complexity. Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code. React js is library and Angular is Framework.

The `framework` provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. If a `library` is used, the application calls the code from the library.

## Ques): What is `CDN`? Why do we use it? (important)
**Ans:** `CDN` stands for `Content Delivery Network`. <br/>
It is a `system of distributed servers` that work together to `deliver web content`, such as images, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and videos, to users based on their `geographical location`.<br/>
The primary purpose of using a CDN is to `enhance the performance, reliability, and efficiency` of delivering web content to end-users.
### Here are some key reasons why CDNs are used:
- Faster Content Delivery
- Improved Website Security
- Scalability
- Global Reach
- Reduction in Bandwidth Costs
### _React & ReactDOM CDN:_
```js
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```


## Ques): Why is `React known as React`?
**Ans:** React is known as `React` because it It `reacts quickly` to changes `without reloading the whole page`. <br/>
The name is derived from the idea of `components reacting to state changes`.<br/>
React is called React because it was designed to be a d`eclarative, efficient, and flexible` JavaScript library for building user interfaces.<br/>
React is a `free and open-source` front-end `JavaScript library` for building `user interfaces(UI)` based on components. It is maintained by `Meta`.


## Ques): What is `crossorigin in script tag`?
**Ans:** The `crossorigin` attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.<br/>
If you serve React from a CDN, we recommend to keep the crossorigin attribute set:
```js
  <script crossorigin src="..."></script>
```
The `crossorigin` attribute in a `<script>` tag is used to control how the browser handles requests for cross-origin scripts. 
The purpose of crossorigin attribute is used to share the resources from one domain to another domain. <br/>
crossorigin refers to making requests to a different domain than the one that served the HTML page. This attribute is commonly used when including external scripts from a different domain, especially when loading scripts from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
### _Syntax_
```js
  <script crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials">
```
### The `crossorigin` attribute can have the following values:
- **anonymous:** This is the default value. When set to "anonymous," the browser makes the request without including any credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) with the request. This is suitable for cases where the script doesn't require authentication.
#### Example:
```js
  <script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
- **use-credentials:** When set to "use-credentials," the browser includes credentials with the request, such as cookies or HTTP authentication. This is used when the script requires authentication to be fetched.
#### Example:
```js
  <script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin="use-credentials"></script>
```

## Ques): What is difference between `React and ReactDOM`?
**Ans:** `React` and `ReactDOM` are both `JavaScript libraries` used for building `user interfaces`. <br/>
`React` is the `core library` for `building user interfaces` in a declarative and component-based manner, while `ReactDOM` is a `specific/separate package` that provides `DOM(Document Object Model)-specific methods` for managing React components. <br/> 
The react package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The react-dom package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in react-dom/server we have server-side rendering support with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.


## Ques): What is difference between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files via `CDN`?
**Ans:** `Development` is the stage of an application before it's made public while `production` is the term used for the same application when it's made `public`.
`Development build` is several times (maybe 3-5x) `slower` than the `production build`.
- **react.development.js** - More developer friendly, readable, will take more size.
```js
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```
- **react.production.js** - Minified code that is not developer friendly as it focused on decreasing in file size, code efficiency.
```js
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
```

## Ques: What are `async and defer` attributes in `<script>` tag?
Ans: The `async` and `defer` attributes are used with the `<script>` element in HTML to control how external `scripts are loaded and executed`. <br/>

**async attribute** - The `async` attribute is a `boolean attribute`. When you include the `async` attribute in a `<script>` tag, it indicates that the script should be `executed asynchronously`. This means that the script will be downloaded in the background while the HTML document continues to be parsed.<br/>
The script will be executed as soon as it's downloaded, regardless of whether the HTML parsing is complete.<br/>
This is beneficial for non-blocking scripts, especially in scenarios where the script doesn't depend on the DOM structure or other scripts.
### _Syntax_
```js
  <script src="example.js" async></script>
```

**defer attribute** - The `defer` attribute is a `boolean attribute`. When you include the `defer` attribute in a `<script>` tag, it indicates that the script should be `executed in order`, after the HTML document has been fully parsed. <br/>
The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.<br/>
This is useful when the script depends on the DOM structure or other scripts and needs to be executed in a specific order.
### _Syntax_
```js
  <script src="example.js" defer></script>
```

Unless you're supporting ancient legacy systems, always add `type="module"` to all your script tags:
```js
  <script type="module" src="main.js"></script> and place the tag inside <head>
```
```js
  <script defer nomodule> can be used as a legacy fallback.
```

As the name suggests, it allows you to import `modules`, which makes it easier to organize your code.
Enable `strict mode` by default. This makes your code run faster, and reports more runtime errors instead of silently ignoring them.<br/>
Execute your code only after the DOM has `initialized`, which makes DOM manipulation easier. Thanks to this, you won't need to listen to load/readystatechange/DOMContentLoaded events.<br/>
Prevent top level variables from implicitly polluting the global namespace.<br/>
Allow you to use top-level await in supported engines.<br/>
Load and parse your code `asynchronously`, which improves load performance.
